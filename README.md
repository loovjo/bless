# `bless` - simple curses-like library for BQN

Dependencies:
* `python3`

Currently only supports running from the repo root directory, to be able to access the `bless.py` and `bless_server.py` files.

See `test.bqn` for a simple showcase of features, and `text_editor.bqn` for a pseudo-text editor.
